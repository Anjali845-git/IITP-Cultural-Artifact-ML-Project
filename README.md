# Cultural Artifact Dataset Exploration
Exploratory work done during my internship at IIT Patna under Dr. Sriparna Saha.
Focused on dataset processing, cultural attribute extraction, and visualizations (wordclouds).
Used LLM assistance (GPT) to understand and test different approaches in text processing.
